# NAME

XT - A viral platform for content aggregation and world domination

# VERSION

version 0.001000

# DESCRIPTION

You've seen them before, 9-gag and all those pesky "funny pics" websites that are forever clogging your `$socialnetwork`.

They're effective at what they do, find cool stuff and make it go viral.

Outside these specific websites, the concept doesn't seem to have spread yet, the only noteworthy example being reddit, which is a generalised approach at unifying a sense of virality with arbitrary content. 

This project is intended to fill this market nich√©, and provide a topic-specific platform for promoting content, in a way that will hopefully supercede the sphere of "Planet" RSS Aggregators, so that gems are more likely to surface, and chaff is more likely to vanish, as opposed to having a perpetual linear stream of randomly variating quality.

In simple terms:

- people submit content ( either by individual content links, or via a feed )
- content is aggregated into a pool
- people vote up/down on content
- people classify content
- "hot" content is delivered to a "hot" page.  
- everyone benefits
